Capstone Idea:  Whispr

I am Bhumi Rastogi from Squad 47 (JECRC University). In this document, I will present my capstone idea, Chat App. I will be using the MERN stack for this project.

Idea Brief:
This chat app consists of features like as usual, you can chat with other people. You can attach anything like images, audio, videos and much more. You will have a notification as well. You will also be able to see the number of unread messages.
If you are typing, others can see that I am typing.


Daily Plan:-
Day 1- Setting up a GitHub account and adding a Readme file.
Day 2- Starting with the front end.
Day 3 - Setting up a route to my home page.
